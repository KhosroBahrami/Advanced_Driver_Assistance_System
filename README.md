# Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) 

The goal of this project is deployment of car, road sign, red light and pedestrian detection sub-systems of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). 
The final product is an embedded system equipped with camera that detect car, red light, stop sign and pedestrian in realtime. 
For Objecte detection Iused SSD objecte detection methods followed by optimization and fine tunning for detection of new objects.

This project has two main steps: 
In the first step, I fine tunned the SSD object detection based on mobilenet backbone network for new 
object detection such as traffic sign and redlight.
In the second step, I deploy the inference part based on mobilenet backbone on embedded system (Dragon board 410C) using C++ to have real-time performance.
